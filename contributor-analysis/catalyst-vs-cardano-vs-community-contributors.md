# Catalyst vs Cardano vs Community Contributors

**Focus areas**

* **Catalyst contributors -** Catalyst contributors focus on the support and improvement of the Catalyst ecosystem that helps with the processes and tools used for the governance and distribution of Cardano treasury funding.
* **Cardano contributors** - Cardano contributors focuses on supporting the Cardano ecosystem such as the developer ecosystem, stake pool node operation, CIP process and governance moderation efforts around parameter changes.
* **Community contributors** - Community contributors can focus on any area of the ecosystem. They could also support Catalyst and Cardano contributor efforts if help was most needed there.



**Roles**

* **Catalyst contributors -** There are [7 roles](https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/catalyst-contributors/catalyst-contributor/roles) including development, coordination, analysis, QA & auditing, marketing, product and design.&#x20;
* **Cardano contributors** - There are [3 roles](https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/cardano-contributors/cardano-contributor/roles) including development, coordination and analysis.
* **Community contributors** - Roles are optional and could either be a suggested role or be fully self determined by the contributor. There are [11 suggested potential roles](https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/community-contributors/community-contributors/roles) that contributors could focus on including development, coordination, analysis, design, product, content creation, education, QA & auditing and marketing.

**Responsibilities**

* **Catalyst contributors** - Responsible for the support and improvement of the Catalyst ecosystem. This can mean supporting the processes and systems involved in the funding process.&#x20;
* **Cardano contributors** - Responsible for the support and improvement of the Cardano ecosystem. This can mean supporting the developer ecosystem, stake pool operation, CIP process and helping moderate governance efforts for parameter changes.
* **Community contributors** - **** No official responsibility is pushed onto community contributors.  Responsibility is self elected or would be agreed responsibility with projects that are looking to support as part of their decision of where they will provide the most value to the ecosystem.

****

**Stewardship & delegated authority**

* **Catalyst contributors** - **** Over time Catalyst contributors can be delegated more authority to manage ecosystem processes and systems instead of IOG to move control closer to the community.
* **Cardano contributors** - Over time Cardano contributors can be delegated more authority to support and moderate the CIP process and governance organisation efforts for parameter changes where that is useful.
* **Community contributors** - Community contributors would not be delegated stewardship and authority over ecosystem systems and processes. They focus on just being elected to contribute to the ecosystem. Stewardship and delegated authority options would likely be further explored in the future.



**Budget considerations**

* **Catalyst contributors** - Catalyst contributors can be given an increasing responsibility to moderate and support the ecosystem. Both the value of someones contributions as well as the amount of responsibility a contributor takes on can both influence the budget that is fair for these contributors.
* **Cardano contributors** - Cardano contributors can be given an increasing responsibility to moderate and support the Cardano CIP process and parameters. Both the value of someones contributions as well as the amount of responsibility a contributor takes on can both influence the budget that is fair for these contributors.
* **Community contributors** - Community contributors initially aren't given increasing responsibility like Catalyst and Cardano contributors. This means their budget value is only determined based on the value of their contributions.



**Summary**

* Catalyst and Cardano contributors have a higher level of responsibility and focus on supporting key parts of the ecosystem. Certain responsibilities will increasingly emerge. With increasing responsibility the budgets attached to these contributors will likely need to reflect that effort and commitment to those areas. Efforts and roles are more guided for Catalyst and Cardano contributors so that the ecosystem has the right skills to push the ecosystem forward in these core areas.
* Community contributors is much more fluid and puts little responsibility onto the contributor. The value of the contributor is fully influenced by the decisions they make on where to support the ecosystem.
