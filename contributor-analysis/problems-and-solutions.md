# Problems & Solutions

### &#x20;Problems

Some key issues were identified with funding contributors as a funding approach and working structure:

* **Clarity** - There is a risk of a lack of clarity on exactly what the contributors would be working on which makes it more difficult to gage whether there will be a good return on intention for a cohort of contributors.
* **Team synergy** - There is a risk that contributors paid for by the treasury don't have a high synergy when working with each other. Contributors may prefer different processes or approaches to other contributors which may lead to decision complexity or potential conflicts.
* **Selecting candidates** - Voters are likely to have much familiarity with the candidates they are voting for to become contributors. A proposal is easier to understand from a high level than working out the potential impact of each contributor. Ranking candidates between others without sufficient information is also difficult.



### **Solutions**

**Usage of roles and minimum thresholds**

[Roles](broken-reference) such as development, coordination, analysis, product and design are used help with clarity for voters other contributors. Contributors can define a role so that it is clear where they intend to be focussing the majority of their time whilst contributing in the ecosystem. This can be mixed with having minimum thresholds for certain roles so there is enough capacity in each areas for the cohort to function effectively and support the ecosystem.

**Clear and open product development workflow**

The product development workflow that the contributors use to improve and maintain the ecosystem will need to be open source and easily viewable by the community. A well defined process followed by contributors will help with both the potential issues of team synergy and clarity.&#x20;

**Fund a DAO instead of contributors individually**

Selecting candidates is a very specific task for the general voters to be expected to vote on. Over time DAO tooling can be created to move from funding contributors into funding a DAO that will have enough functionality to be managed by the community and used by the contributors. As one improvement having engaged community members vote for who becomes a full time contributor would make more sense than general voters in the long term. The area general voters vote is most needed concern more general direction and focuses of the core ecosystem. Any general voter should be able to become an engaged community member if they want to help vote on who are the full time contributors.&#x20;
