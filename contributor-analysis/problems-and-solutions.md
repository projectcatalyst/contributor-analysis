# Problems & Solutions

### &#x20;Problems

Some key issues were identified with funding contributors as a funding approach and working structure:

* **1. Clarity** - There is a risk of a lack of clarity on exactly what the contributors would be working on which makes it more difficult to gage whether there will be a good return on intention for a cohort of contributors.
* **2. Team synergy** - There is a risk that contributors paid for by the treasury don't have a high synergy when working with each other. Contributors may prefer different processes or approaches to other contributors which may lead to decision complexity or potential conflicts.
* **3. Selecting candidates** - Voters are not likely to have high familiarity with all the candidates they would voting on to become contributors. A proposal is easier to understand from a higher level than working out the potential impact of individual contributors. Ranking contributor candidates against others without sufficient information would be difficult.



### **Solutions**

**Usage of roles and minimum thresholds**

[Roles](broken-reference) such as development, coordination, analysis, product and design are used help with clarity for voters other contributors. Contributors can define a role so that it is clear where they intend to be focussing the majority of their time whilst contributing in the ecosystem. This can be mixed with having minimum thresholds for certain roles so there is enough capacity in each areas for the cohort to function effectively and support the ecosystem.

**Clear and open product development workflow**

The product development workflow that the contributors use to improve and maintain the ecosystem will need to be open source and easily viewable by the community. A well defined process followed by contributors will help with both the potential issues of team synergy and clarity.&#x20;

**Contributor focussed dReps**

dReps is offering a way for community members to delegate their voting power to other people who want to be representatives in the ecosystem. dReps could provide an effective solution for people who do not want to do the research and analysis to come to conclusions on which contributors to elect. Some dReps may decide to focus entirely on understanding the candidates who are applying to become full time contributors. dReps could be an effective way to provide comparisons between candidates that voters could then use to vote themselves if they didn't want to delegate their voting power but did want to get a mixture of perspectives from representatives before making their own voting decisions.

**Contributor previous participation and voting information**&#x20;

Contributors should over time be able to have credentials and identity based tools that they can use to prove and verify how they have participated in the ecosystem. This can mean providing evidence of what initiatives they participated in or how they have voted on certain changes to the ecosystem. This information then can be used to give voters an easier way to find contributors that they believe have the right skills, knowledge or view points to be suitable as an elected contributor.
