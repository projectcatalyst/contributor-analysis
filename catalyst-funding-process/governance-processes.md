# Governance Processes

Creating an effective governance process is inherently difficult because of the need to involve participants that have different amounts of knowledge, skill and also different perspectives and cultural backgrounds. There are usually always trade offs with governance. A starting point for making a better governance systems is by thinking about the complexity of decisions, participants involved and actual governance process itself.



### Governance decision examples

There are a number of decisions that will need to be made within the Catalyst ecosystem. The following factors should be considered for each decision:

* **Complexity** - How complex is the governance decision? What knowledge do the participants need to have?
* **Timeliness** - How fast should a decision be made? Is the decision time sensitive?
* **Accountability** - Should those participating in governance for this decision be accountable for the decision made? Can participants be anonymous?
* **Participants** - Who does the decision impact? Which people should be involved in the decision? How should participants verify they can vote?
* **Feedback required** - What level of feedback is required and from which participants? How much information is required for any governance participants to make a well informed decision?



**1. Request for $2,000 of extra funds to support a hackathon event that received an unexpected amount of increased popularity nearer the event date**

* **Complexity** - This decision is of low complexity, those that participate in voting need to understand the track record of the event and event organisers and how the money would be spent.
* **Timeliness** - As the decision is time sensitive this is more suited to a rapid governance process from trusted community members who can manage some portion of the treasury for this type of purpose.
* **Accountability** - Using less participants to govern the decision more quickly increases the need for accountability over the decision. The community benefits from seeing who made this decision and why.
* **Participants** - As complexity is low and speed is important the governance will be most suited to a smaller circle of participants such as full time contributors to the ecosystem. Voting participants should need to verify they are full time contributors selected by the community.
* **Feedback required** - The community would benefit from being able to provide feedback to this decision before it gets approved in case there was any missing information or negative feedback. Negative feedback could lead to increasing the number of participants that should be involved in the governance to increase confidence over the result.



**2. Implementation decision for a Catalyst service to use either React or Vue as a frontend framework**

* **Complexity** - This governance decision requires a certain amount of knowledge from the participants about the implications of using either frontend framework. For those relevant participants involved the complexity is moderate.
* **Timeliness** - The decision does not need to be executed immediately, adding enough information to support each option in the decision will be needed to produce a more well informed decision.
* **Accountability** - As this decision is more suited to a smaller group of contributors with the required knowledge it is also suitable to have accountability towards the decision made by the contributors and reasons they chose that path. This puts accountability on them to the wider community and allows the community to respond in the future if they believe that process needs improving or the contributors did not make a well informed decision.
* **Participants** - The governance is less suited to a wider proposal process and instead the usage of an internal product development workflow along with content around the pros and cons for each option may make more sense. Participants suitable would be those contributors who have the required knowledge that can provide valued input into the decision. Voting participants should need to verify they are full time contributors selected by the community.
* **Feedback required** - This decision requires lots of feedback from the participants involved due to the amount of variables that will influence which option is a better choice. You would expect the decision to leave plenty of time for voting participants to add data and feedback to each option to help create a well informed decision.



**3. Request for funds to build out a new AI tool to automatically assess proposals**

* **Complexity** - This complexity of this decisions is at least moderate too high as those who govern the decision need to understand the implications of how the AI tool would work and whether it would actually be effective. A proposal process could work for this decision but it could also be governed by contributors if they have their own managed treasury to maintain the ecosystem.
* **Timeliness** - Decision has no immediate pressure to be executed quickly.
* **Accountability** - If the decision is performed by the wider community in a proposal process no accountability is needed from the voters as it was performed with the maximum participants. If the decision was instead executed by full time contributors that maintain a separate treasury the accountability would be important with transparent exposure to who voted on the decision and their reasoning.
* **Participants** - This is a good example where contributors in the ecosystem should seek for feedback from the wider community on their thoughts of the suggested idea. That feedback can help lead to whether this decision just uses full time contributors to make the decision or the wider community should be involved.
* **Feedback required** - This decision requires feedback from both those with the knowledge on the idea itself but also the wider community as it would be a bigger decision to govern. In most cases it will need to go through a proposal process and get enough wider feedback and governance from the community.



**4. New parameter changes**

* **Complexity** - This change could be of any complexity however the implications of the change are important to the whole Project Catalyst community. The implications of this are that the information behind the change need to be very well documented and for that information to be shared to the community who would be voting on the change. This decision is well suited to a proposal with supporting information on the change.
* **Timeliness** - This change could have time constraints under a sudden severe adversarial attack. However in most cases this decision should not be time sensitive and plenty of time should be made available due to the implications of the change.
* **Accountability** - If the change impacts the entire community it should generally include the wider community as participants. In this instance there would be no accountability on the voters. However there would be accountability on any full time contributors to ensure all the information required is available to the community about the implications of the changes being made so that all the facts are known.
* **Participants** - The wider community should be involved as parameter changes will usually directly impact them.
* **Feedback required** - Full time contributors in the ecosystem will need to collate information around the change and allow for the wider community to give feedback and then iterate and improve this information until an informed decision can be made.



### Governance using groups vs individuals

The implications of having governance from groups such as project teams versus individuals is an important topic to consider.



**Groups**

* **Vote weighting** - If vote weighting was 1 group 1 vote then there is an incentive to create multiple groups to manipulate a given vote. If it becomes 1 individual 1 vote under a group format then they have the incentive to increase the number of people in their group. 1 group 1 vote will rarely make sense as one large group shouldnâ€™t have significantly less voting power than a small group.
* **Participants** - If vote weighting is based on individuals under a group dynamic then the group needs regulation on how individuals join that group otherwise it becomes easy to manipulate the governance process.
* **Competition** - If groups compete in anyway, especially in a financial way, then an incentive can emerge to discredit other groups when making decisions and interacting with others.
* **Groupthink** - Individuals forming under a group making decisions about policies or funding could more easily suffer from the influences of [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink).



**Individuals**

* **Vote weighting** - Each individual will have equal weighting for governance.
* **Participants** - When concerning individuals as voting participants the main concern is which individuals should be involved in a given governance decision. Sometimes using a subset of the wider community for an ecosystem can make sense for certain decisions. For instance you may want to ask any community member that has done an assessment using two approaches to vote on which they preferred. Verifying the previous involvement of the individual in assessments here would be important for improving the quality of the answer.
* **Accountability** - Accountability is a key aspect for governance as any decision will need to determine who may be accountable for any part of that decision or information leading up to the decision. It should also be clear whether individuals can be anonymous or not due to the need for accountability.



**Summary**

* Doing governance using groups over individuals introduces a number of potential risks and ways a governance system could be gamed. If this approach was to be applied to any governance system thorough planning and analysis is required on the policies and incentives involved.
* Individuals is often used for governance as it makes for a fairer democratic process. Some key things to consider for individuals within governance processes is who should be involved and what accountability they would have when voting on decisions.



### Catalyst Circle

The initial Catalyst Circle was created to help with identifying the problems that exist in the Catalyst ecosystem, which of those problems were highest priority and then the guidance and support of solutions to those problems. The circle was responsible for communicating these problems, solutions and all decisions to the community for feedback whilst keeping the whole process transparent.



**Issues**

* **Lower commitment** - Catalyst circle members do not need to work in the ecosystem full time which can limit the value they provide as there is no guarantee that they spend the remainder of their time in the ecosystem. This lower commitment brings in the potential issue of member knowledge gaps as there is an increased chance they may not be up to date or aware of everything happening in the ecosystem.
* **Limited outcomes and execution** - The circle often does not deal with implementation details and due to its small structure would also practically not be a large enough team to execute solutions.
* **Small governance size** - Less than ten people are generally involved in the Catalyst Circle process. This has limitations on availability of diverse knowledge and skills being involved. It also will often mean that governance is not representative of all the full time contributors in the ecosystem.
* **Complexity** - Catalyst Circles are funded by proposals which results in the same complexities that come with proposal based funding. This included scattered funding, budget inaccuracies and added complexity from detailed proposal information.



**Advantages**

* **Supports a product development workflow** - The circle has helped add some structure to the process of identifying problems through to suggesting solutions which helps to bring the community together on building solutions. Unfortunately the benefit stops at the solution suggestions stage as this is where proposals must come in to fill the gaps which have the proposal based funding issues covered in the [funding approaches](funding-approaches.md).
* **Transparent** - All meetings and information around circle meetings is recorded and public to the community.
* **Community voted** - The community democratically votes on who is elected into the circle. The number of participants that vote on any Catalyst Circle member decision has to date been low and should be noted as an ongoing concern.
* **Flexible** - The circle members can move their attention onto other concerns quickly that helps them maximise their impact.



**Summary**

* The Catalyst circle does not ensure that outcomes are delivered as the circle is not required to take problems through to solution.
* The governance process is effective in helping with the start of a product development workflow which helps to organise and structure problems and potential solutions to consider within the ecosystem.
* The Catalyst Circle would benefit from members needing to be full time in the ecosystem so that there is increased capability and confidence that any involved have the right knowledge and exposure to make well informed decisions. This full time commitment would mean these members become full time contributors.
* The governance of Project Catalyst should not be limited to a handful of people due to the risks of having a lack of full representation of the ecosystem and the increased chance of gaps with knowledge or skills. Involving all full time contributors of the ecosystem would be more inclusive and representative of those who should have sufficient knowledge to govern changes to the ecosystem.



### Rapid funding

Rapid funding is exploring how to make it possible for the Project Catalyst community to have faster access to funding compared to the current use of a more slow and laborious proposal process. For rapid funding to be effective it needs to consider where funds can be allocated, who is involved in that governance process and what accountability is needed.



**Issues**

* **Accountability** - If community members and projects are funded in a faster speed it makes it less suitable to try and involve the entire community in the decision. If the decision is delegated to a group of people then thereâ€™s a need for accountability as to who was involved in the decision and the reasons why the chose to fund or not fund a given request.
* **Governance process** - The process used for governance for rapid funding needs to match concerns around timeliness and the amount of funding involved. To make well informed and faster decisions the participants who are delegated the responsibility will need to be fully informed on what is happening in the ecosystem and be aware of community members and contributors. Due to this full time contributors will be some of the most effective community members to use for this process due to having the most time being actively committed to the ecosystem.
* **Decision complexity** - A difficulty for rapid funding is determining which governance decisions should be involved and excluded. Simple decisions such as supporting a local hackathon may be easy to include however when the funding request is larger the governance participants involved need to have guidelines and a feedback process in place to decide when to involve a larger amount of the community instead of executing the decision themselves.



**Advantages**

* **Speed** - Providing funding to projects and teams that needs it at a faster rate can help with increasing the speed of innovation and adoption of the ecosystem.
* **Simple process** - The current proposal process for Project Catalyst is too slow for many small projects which leads to stagnation. By having a simple process these teams can have a governance process that is better suited for the smaller requests that are being made giving them more capacity to focus on making impact over the admin work involved with proposals.



**Summary**

* Full time contributors are well suited to supporting a rapid funding mechanism in Project Catalyst as their votes can be public and those involved be made accountable.
* Guidelines and further thought is needed by those contributors on which things can be funded through that process and which can use the process but require a much larger feedback process with the community.
