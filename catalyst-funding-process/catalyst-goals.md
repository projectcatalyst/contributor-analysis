  Catalyst can reach its potential as an ecosystem.

# Catalyst Goals

[Project Catalyst](https://cardano.ideascale.com) is focussed on creating solutions that help with the governance of the Cardano treasury. The ecosystem helps with nurturing new innovation and improvements to the wider ecosystem.

There are a number of sensible goals that can be outlined. First are general goals on how the ecosystem is developed and maintained and the second is working environment goals to help maximise the chances the ecosystem has to attract high quality talent.



## General goals

The better that Project Catalyst can effectively and efficiently govern the treasury for Cardano the more it can deliver on its overall mission to bring new innovation and improvements to the wider Cardano ecosystem. There are a number of sensible high level goals the ecosystem can strive towards so it can reach its potential. This following list is non-exhaustive. Suggestions for additions or improvements are welcomed.



* **High quality -** The services and processes available within the ecosystem should be to a high quality. Each service in the ecosystem should provide an easy to understand, secure and high quality user experience. The higher quality and easier to use the ecosystem is the more easily it will be to attract new contributors and projects.
* **Maintainable -** The different services and processes that make up the ecosystem should be built in a way that they are maintainable for the contributors that manage the ecosystem. Being maintainable will mean using suitable technical approaches with good processes along with bringing alignment where possible. The better aligned the different services are the less that new contributors will need to learn to get involved and the more they can share their skills and knowledge easily across the ecosystem.
* **Robust governance -** Governance of the ecosystem will need to be robust using the right checks and balances, incentives and safety measures to prevent any security risks or opportunities for corruption. Strong governance will mean inviting all the necessary community members for each relevant governance decision and ensuring that the relevant factual information is present so that voters are well informed.
* **Economic -** For Project Catalyst to be most impactful it needs to optimise its operational cost so more funds are available to maximise the number of new innovations and improvements coming into the ecosystem. The more cost effective the ecosystem can be maintained the more that new innovations can be funded. Part of making the ecosystem economic will be trying to minimise duplicated efforts, optimising processes and services and also helping with reducing the amount of resources going into areas that will produce low impact outcomes.



## Working environment goals

For people who are working to improve and maintain the Catalyst ecosystem there are a number of goals to consider that would create a good working environment that increase the chances of achieving the more general goals of the Catalyst ecosystem.



* **Collaborative** - Contributors improving the ecosystem will be most impactful when they are able to share ideas, skills and knowledge so they are able to make the most amount of impact possible. The better collaboration and synergy between contributors the faster trust and rapport can be built up that supports more rapid innovation.
* **High alignment** - Contributors need an effective way to come to agreement on complex product and ecosystem issues. To achieve this those involved will need an effective product development workflow to ensure the right people are involved at each stage of the process before moving through to implementation. Better alignment helps increase consistency in the user experience, technical implementation (data models, APIs, integrations) and processes. Stronger alignment also makes it easier for new contributors to join in to support the ecosystems evolution.
* **Flexible** - Those helping maintain and improve the ecosystem will be most impactful if the environment is flexible for them to move where they are needed most. Contributors shouldnâ€™t be tied to a single thing if there is something that they would be more effective at supporting and it produces more impact.
* **Focussed** - Contributors spending most of their time solving problems and supporting the community will be more effective if they can avoid unnecessary administrative work. This means developing and using tools and processes that make contributors more efficient. Areas of focus could include proposal writing, unnecessary meetings or simplifying any financial and tax burdens to work in the ecosystem.
* **Accountable** - As the rate of treasury funds distribution increase so does the increased risk that is involved with its governance. Tools and processes will be needed to ensure that those contributing have sufficient accountability to minimise the chance they make mistakes or could be a hidden bad actor.
* **Incentivised** - Those improving the ecosystem should be incentivised to do so. Contributors who make significantly high impact should be further rewarded. To attract the best talent into the ecosystem the environment will need to consider the importance of using effective incentivisation.
