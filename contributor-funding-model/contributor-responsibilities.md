# Contributor Responsibilities

### **Coordinate**

Contributors can be an effective group for bringing the community together for events and discussion about important topics, changes and problems. Coordination across the ecosystem should also mean trying to align efforts, reduce duplication and encourage open source solutions to maximise collaboration across the ecosystem.



### **Support**

Support can be provided to newcomers and existing community members in understanding how the ecosystem functions, how to participate and answering questions people may have.



### **Maintain**&#x20;

Contributors can be delegated authority and stewardship over parts of the ecosystem to ensure everything is running smoothly and to prevent bad actors. This can mean helping maintain documentation, infrastructure, processes and communication channels.



### **Improve**

The ecosystem will need to be improved and electing contributors, along with the involvement of the community, can be an effective approach to help with building and improving the infrastructure, tools, services and processes used across the ecosystem.



### **Facilitate**&#x20;

Decisions will need to be made on a regular basis that could impact how the ecosystem operates or functions. Contributors are well suited to gather the information that is needed to facilitate those decisions, discussions and events that lead to change and improvement of the ecosystem.



### **Distribute**

Contributors are not supposed to solve and work on every problem set. Instead contributors should also aim to identify and support other community ideas and initiatives that help to support, maintain and improve the ecosystem. If the cohort of contributors manage their own treasury fund they can also help to support initiatives that can create positive impact in the ecosystem.
