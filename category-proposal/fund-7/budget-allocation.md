# Budget Allocation

Analysis is provided below on the amount of contributors that would be funded depending on the total challenge funding available and against different average requests amounts per candidate to gage how many contributors would be join full time into the ecosystem. The percentage of the fund requested for fund 8 is also highlighted which is $12,800,000

****

**$400,000 total allocation (3.13% fund allocation)**

* $50,000 per contributor - 8 contributors
* $40,000 per contributor - 10 contributors
* $30,000 per contributor - 13 contributors

****

**$600,000 total allocation (4.69% fund allocation)**

* $50,000 per contributor - 12 contributors
* $40,000 per contributor - 15 contributors
* $30,000 per contributor - 20 contributors

****

**$800,000 total allocation (6.25% fund allocation)**

* $50,000 per contributor - 16 contributors
* $40,000 per contributor - 20 contributors
* $30,000 per contributor - 26 contributors

****

**$1,000,000 total allocation (7.81% fund allocation)**

* $50,000 per contributor - 20 contributors
* $40,000 per contributor - 25 contributors
* $30,000 per contributor - 33 contributors

****

**Summary**

* Even the largest allocation of $1,000,000 is below 8% of the total fund available for fund 8 so the risk of the challenge to the fund size is relatively small.
* Both the $600,000 to $800,000 requested fund amounts bring in a moderate amount of contributors. The risk on the lower amounts is if only 12 contributors are brought in there is a risk that there isn't a diverse enough set of skills and types of contributor.
* The $800,000 bracket provides enough room to ensure we can bring in enough contributors from a mixed skill set which will be an important part of this challenge as an experiment. This requested amount also limits the fund exposure to 6.25%.
* The challenge to date has seen a positive response from the community which shows a strong sign it will comfortably fill enough candidates into a $800,000 funding amount.
