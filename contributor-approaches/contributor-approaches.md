# Contributor Approaches

### What is a contributor?

A contributor is anyone who helps to support, improve or maintain the Cardano ecosystem. For example a contributor could support people with improving their proposals, help with improving the tooling used for assessing proposals or could help with managing the data that comes out of the voting process.



### Responsibilities: Roles vs Full autonomy

**Roles** - Contributors specify their professional background, existing contributions and also pick a roles (e.g. development, coordination, marketing) where they will spend the majority of their time whilst contributing to the ecosystem.

* Provides clarity on where contributors are interested in focussing their time. Contributors can mention a main role but could provide support to other areas in the ecosystem.
* Provides clarity to the community on how the ecosystem functions and what the key areas are in the ecosystem which require the help from contributors.

****

**Full autonomy** - Contributors have the freedom to work in any area of the ecosystem and only provide information on their professional background and existing contributions.

* Provides complete freedom to the contributor which may be an appealing factor for becoming a contributor more than having a specific area of focus.
* Risk increases for not having enough people for specific skills to move the ecosystem forward. For instance if many contributors got hired where no one had development experience there would be little development of the product from a technical standpoint. This outcome would slow progress down for ecosystem improvements.

****

**Summary**

* Any organisation would suffer from having too many of one type of skill set to manage their ecosystem. Due to this contributors should have an area of focus in the ecosystem.
* To provide flexibility contributors specifying a role can still help in other areas. The contributors main task is to provide maximum impact to the ecosystem which might mean helping in other areas. The contributor should aim to spend the majority of their time in the role they specify. Contributors can change their role in future funding rounds.
* The ecosystem will benefit from having a balanced amount of skills within a cohort of contributors. To achieve this a minimum threshold can be applied to each role so that the minimum required positions are filled when a cohort of candidates go through the process.
* A surplus amount can be included in the total budget to allow for flexibility in the type of contributors included in the cohort. As a surplus flexibility example, an entire contributors budget could be $500,000. The minimum role thresholds are 4 development, 2 coordination, 1 analysis and 1 product each with a capped salary of $50,000 for 6 months. The surplus in this scenario would be $100,000 meaning at a minimum two contributors could be introduced that have any role. Contributors beyond the threshold would be selected based off who received the highest votes after the thresholds were met for each role.



### Budget: Seniority ranges vs Self selected

**Seniority ranges** - The contributors present a budget based on their seniority within the provided role budget range. E.g. The development role could have a $35,000 (junior) to $50,000 (senior) budget range for a 6 month term.

* Providing budget ranges makes it easy for contributors to assign themselves a suitable budget.
* Seniority ranges require an ongoing governance process to determine what those budget ranges should be that also consider the other incentives involved for being a contributor (e.g. bonuses due to impact).
* Risk of reducing the amount of skilled contributors if they are deterred by a limiting budget range.

****

**Self selected** - The contributors get no guidance for specifying a budget and instead self determine the value they believe is fair based off any evidence provided.

* More time consuming and difficult for a contributor to decide and justify a given budget
* Contributor has freedom to be paid exactly what they believe they are worth
* Risks a contributor being underpaid if they adjust their salary based off their confidence in being voted on or are unaware what the value of their role is in terms of skills required and the responsibilities included.
* Risks a contributor is overpaid due a highly skilled professional background that justifies a higher budget but those skills not transferring effectively to the contributor role in a way that provides an effective return for the ecosystem. It would also be difficult to adjust their budget after it has been funded without high friction!

****

**Summary**

* Seniority budget ranges make it easier for contributors to justify a budget when proposing to be a contributor. There is a moderate chance of a contributor asking for too little or too much without having any budget guidance in place.
* The risk of deterring highly skilled contributors can be mitigated by using a bonus for impactful contributors. This better aligns incentives as the bonus is paid after that fact that a contributor has provided high impact rather than in a salary which is before any evidence of providing value from their contributions. An impact bonus could turn the contributor role into something far more lucrative that aligns incentives and is mutually beneficial for the community and contributor.
* A documented governance process will be needed at some stage for setting the role budget ranges between funding rounds.&#x20;
* Beyond the approach of an impact bonus contributors are also welcomed to help with areas such as doing proposal assessments which would increase their total compensation.



### **Work:** Term based vs Permanent

**Term based work** - A contributor could be funded for a fixed term, such as 6 months.

* Reduces risk by allocating a smaller fixed amount of funding to contributors who may have yet to prove they will provide a high impact.
* Increased risk of having constant change of contributors which could lead to a lack of in depth knowledge of the ecosystem.
* Current funding model is better suited to introduction of term based funding as it can be added into existing process.

****

**Permanent work** - The contributor is paid to work full time with a full time contract and repeatedly gets funded until they leave or are dismissed from their duties.

* Requires more assurances that the candidate will be an impactful contributor as if not a process for dismissal is needed.
* Provides stability to the contributor which could attract more people into the roles as there is a safety in being able to produce an income.

****

**Summary**

* There is more simplicity in using a term based employment of 6 months at the moment.&#x20;
* To mitigate the risk of the changing contributors one thing to consider is contributors as a collective can manage a Catalyst contributor treasury that would come from the main Cardano treasury. This pot can be used to fund other tasks and people in the community. This could help keep people employed in the ecosystem as if they didn't get voted in for a particular fund then the contributors could vote to fund them through the contributors own managed funding treasury.
* The length of the term can be explored more in the future, some roles may be better suited for 3 months and other 12 months depending on what work they are focussed on. In either scenario the contributors can set aside money for specific tasks for more of a gig economy style of income for those that prefer that. Iteration in these areas should provide a good coverage of catering for how different contributors want to work within the ecosystem.



### Summary

* **Roles** - Contributors should have a role so that there are better assurances that there will always be enough skills available for each core part of the ecosystem.
* **Budget ranges** - Roles should include budget ranges that represent junior to senior experience levels that will help guide candidates when making a proposal to add a sensible budget request.
* **Impact bonus** - An impact bonus can be explored and introduced in the future to further align incentives for contributors by rewarding those that provide high impact to the ecosystem.
* **Term based work** - Contributors will initially request a budget for a fixed 6 month term of work.
