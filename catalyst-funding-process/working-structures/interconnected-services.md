# Interconnected Services

Under the ecosystem goals the different stages of the Project Catalyst funding process are covered. These different stages represent services in the wider Catalyst product. An important factor to discuss is how these services are interconnected and not independent. This factor is important to determine suitable funding and working structures for how those services are implemented and maintained.

Project Catalyst has a number of services within the ecosystem that are interconnected. For example the proposal submission service is closely linked with others services such as those about assessment or voting as they require the data and integration from the other. These services do not act independently from one another as they need data and users to flow from one service to the other easily whilst people interact with the ecosystem.



## Product factors for interconnected services

A number of factors need to be considered when thinking about how interconnected services are funded, developed and maintained.



**Breaking changes**

Services that rely on surrounding services to function correctly create a risk of breaking changes caused by another service being updated. This risk results in a constant need effective communication.



**Differing implementation quality**

How interconnected services are developed will change the overall product quality. If there are separate teams they will need to consider how they can access and get feedback from talent across the product ecosystem to ensure a high implementation quality can be achieved.



**Diverging implementation approaches**

Complexity of implementation is a concern for interconnected services. If each services uses different implementation approaches and processes the overall product becomes more complex meaning the skills required to work in the ecosystem increases. The more complex implementations becomes the more friction it adds in attracting and retaining talent to maintain those services. Better alignment on implementation can make it faster to iterate as a whole and also lead to a more cohesive user experience.



**Different user experiences**

Considerations are needed for interconnected services to stay aligned on creating a high quality user experience. If services run independently there is a risk that they provide a user experience that does not match what is provided elsewhere. These differences could lead to confusion and a product that becomes harder to use.



**Collaboration**

The need for collaboration between interconnected service teams is high as how they iterate impacts the other surrounding services. Knowledge and skills shared across teams help to improve the product development workflow and governance process of each service. This involves collaboration on supporting the problem sensing, prioritisation, solution options and solution implementation approach used by each service.



**Governance**

Each interconnected service needs a breadth of ideas and knowledge from well informed participants to make better decisions about how to improve each service. If governance is siloed with less people working independently there is a risk of decreasing the shared knowledge that is needed to make well informed governance decisions.



**Funding**

How interconnected services are funded is important for the effectiveness of how they collaborate and work together. If the funding gain of one service meant the loss for another there is a risk of creating a bad environment for collaboration between services. Interconnected services require deep collaboration to be most effective so how they are funded is of high importance.



## Summary

* Project Catalyst has a number of interconnected services that represent the wider product experience.
* Interconnected services and not independent and rely on each other for data and integrations.
* Interconnected services will function best in an environment that supports high collaboration, non competitive funding and shared governance oversight. The best possible environment is vital for success due the dependence that each service has on others.
* The more efficient and effortless it is for interconnected services to work together the more that funding from the Cardano treasury can be allocated to new innovations that drive the ecosystem forward.
