# Achieving Ecosystem Goals

A contributor funding model can help with achieving the goals of creating ecosystems that are scalable, resilient, efficient, high quality, maintainable and community owned.

The[ Catalyst Product Development documentation](https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/catalyst-product-development/funding-process/catalyst-ecosystem-goals) gives an example of how these high level ecosystem goals apply and why they are important.



### **Scalable**

The community is able to increase or decrease the amount of full time contributors it needs as the ecosystem evolves. Increasing the number of elected contributors helps the ecosystem to scale when more support, maintenance or improvement is needed.



### **Resilient**&#x20;

Contributors are elected to work full time in the ecosystem to work on what produces the most impact. This can mean directing their full attention to sudden issues that need resolving. Contributors are not tied to the execution of ideas.



### **Efficient**

Contributors are elected and incentivised to work full time in the ecosystem. Contributors then have full capacity to most effectively and efficiently perform their role. Once elected contributors do not need to constantly write idea based proposals and can focus instead on producing the most impact.



### **High Quality**

The Catalyst and Cardano ecosystems are complex and is a reason why having full time contributors with a diverse skill set is important. A cohort of contributors with the skill diversity and sufficient capacity will mean increasing the chance they can produce high quality outcomes in the infrastructure and processes they help to improve.



### **Maintainable**

Funding contributors to produce impact rather than ideas means contributors are incentivised to find the most efficient solution to a problem rather than compete over funded ideas. This incentive for collaboration will help to increase alignment and prevent duplicated efforts that can result in a more maintainable ecosystem.



### **Community Owned**

A contributor funding model helps to achieve community ownership as the contributors are elected by the community. These contributors will be elected to help support, maintain and improve the ecosystem meaning the ecosystem remains functional, efficient and resilient under a decentralized ownership structure.
