# Overview

The Catalyst contributors are a group of community members who help to manage, support and improve the Catalyst ecosystem. The Catalyst ecosystem helps to govern the distribution of the Cardano treasury. Contributors help in a multitude of areas including working on infrastructure and tooling, supporting the community, improving processes or supporting other projects in the ecosystem.

A key objective for the Catalyst Contributors is to help create the best environment possible for full time contributors. A good environment will mean maximising the alignment and collaboration between these contributors so they are able to most effectively maximise their impact when working on improving the ecosystem.&#x20;
